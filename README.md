This project was completed as part of our final semester (2024) IMSc(IT) program. It focuses on detecting credit card fraud in online transactions using real-world data from Kaggle. We implemented and compared machine learning models — SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression — achieving up to 98.99% accuracy.
